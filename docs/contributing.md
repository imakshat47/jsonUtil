# Contributing

## Workflow
- Fork and create a feature branch
- Write or update tests
- Keep changes focused; add docs updates
- Open a PR with context and screenshots (when applicable)

## Code style
- Prefer ES modules
- Add JSDoc for exported functions where helpful
- Keep endpoints documented in /docs

## Security & crypto
- Document any changes that affect SYSTEM_KEY, encryption formats, or auth
- Provide migration notes if older logs or headers are affected
